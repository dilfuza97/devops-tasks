### Tutorial: Continuous integration of ARM templates with Azure Pipelines

Azure DevOps provides developer services to support teams to plan work, collaborate on code development, and build and deploy applications. Developers can work in the cloud using Azure DevOps Services. Azure DevOps provides an integrated set of features that you can access through your web browser or IDE client. Azure Pipeline is one of these features. Azure Pipelines is a fully featured continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) service. It works with your preferred Git provider and can deploy to most major cloud services. Then you can automate the build, testing, and deployment of your code to Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, or Amazon Web Services.


**This tutorial covers the following tasks:**

- Prepare a GitHub repository
- Create an Azure DevOps project
- Create an Azure pipeline
- Verify the pipeline deployment
